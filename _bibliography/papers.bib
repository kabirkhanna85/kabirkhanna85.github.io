  title = {Decoherence due to Spacetime Curvature},
  abstract = {There has been considerable interest over the past years in investigating the role of gravity in quantum phenomenon such as entanglement and decoherence. In particular, gravitational time dilation is believed to decohere superpositions of center of mass of composite quantum systems. Since true effects of gravity are encoded in the curvature of spacetime, the universality of such a decoherence must be characterized through components of Riemann tensor Rabcd, with a clear separation from non-inertial kinematic effects. We obtain the reduced density matrix of a composite system in a generic curved spacetime, and express the decoherence time scale explicitly in terms of curvature. The decoherence in an inertial frame is caused by tidal acceleration. We also analyse the effects of self-gravity and show that the coupling of gravitational interaction with external curvature can not be captured by the replacement m→m+Hint/c2.},

  title = {GUP Corrections to the Jaynes-Cummings Model},
  abstract = {The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) is a modification of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle predicted by several theories of quantum gravity. In this work, we compute GUP corrections to the well-known Jaynes-Cummings Model (JCM) with the aim of eventually observing quantum gravity effects in quantum optical systems. To this end, we first analytically solve the GUP-corrected JCM and obtain the corrected Rabi frequency in the quadratic GUP model. Following this, we calculate the effects of a dispersive interaction with light in a coherent state and show that this gives rise to photon-added coherent states that were first studied by Agarwal and Tara in 1991. The latter causes a change in the value of the Wigner function, which if detected in the laboratory, would in effect be a signature of quantum gravity.},

  title = {Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry},
abstract = {Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong’’, i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.}

  title = {Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory},
abstract = {Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.},
