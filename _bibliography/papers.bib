  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title = {Decoherence due to Spacetime Curvature},
  abstract = {There has been considerable interest over the past years in investigating the role of gravity in quantum phenomenon such as entanglement and decoherence. In particular, gravitational time dilation is believed to decohere superpositions of center of mass of composite quantum systems. Since true effects of gravity are encoded in the curvature of spacetime, the universality of such a decoherence must be characterized through components of Riemann tensor Rabcd, with a clear separation from non-inertial kinematic effects. We obtain the reduced density matrix of a composite system in a generic curved spacetime, and express the decoherence time scale explicitly in terms of curvature. The decoherence in an inertial frame is caused by tidal acceleration. We also analyse the effects of self-gravity and show that the coupling of gravitational interaction with external curvature can not be captured by the replacement m→m+Hint/c2.},

  title = {GUP Corrections to the Jaynes-Cummings Model},
  abstract = {The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) is a modification of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle predicted by several theories of quantum gravity. In this work, we compute GUP corrections to the well-known Jaynes-Cummings Model (JCM) with the aim of eventually observing quantum gravity effects in quantum optical systems. To this end, we first analytically solve the GUP-corrected JCM and obtain the corrected Rabi frequency in the quadratic GUP model. Following this, we calculate the effects of a dispersive interaction with light in a coherent state and show that this gives rise to photon-added coherent states that were first studied by Agarwal and Tara in 1991. The latter causes a change in the value of the Wigner function, which if detected in the laboratory, would in effect be a signature of quantum gravity.},
