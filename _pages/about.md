Hey all üëãüèæ ! I‚Äôm Kabir, a second year PhD student at UMass Amherst. I work with [Prof. Romain Vasseur](https://blogs.umass.edu/rvasseur/) on topics related to quantum dynamics using tools from quantum computing quantum information theory. However, I am interested in all things quantum condensed matter theory.

As far as theoretical physicists go, I have a non-traditional academic background. I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/) and a master‚Äôs in [Quantum Science & Technology](https://quantum.iitm.ac.in/programmes/) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) (IITM) in July 2022.

<!-- In my years at IITM, I was interested in semi-classical methods at the intersection of field theory, general relativity, and quantum information.
My master‚Äôs thesis was on <em>Aspects of Quantum Information in Curved Spacetimes</em> and explored the interplay between gravity and quantum information using just these kinds of semi-classical methods. A paper based on some of this work can be found below. -->

I also hold an [MSc in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematical-and-theoretical-physics) from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), a short yet intense course in theoretical physics. You can find the list of courses offered [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhJ5_GwTvyxnIryoCewyi_9W5hqgMzjX/view?usp=sharing).

<!-- Recently my interests have shifted towards studying quantum information theoretic aspects in condensed matter physics. This is the broad area of my dissertation at Oxford. -->

Besides physics, I like to learn languages, geek out about coffee, and if the circumstances call for it, go all out with my guitar.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
